# WildRTP
With the help of the WildRTP, you can use a command to teleport to a random location. You are put on the top block to prevent fall damage. The maximum X and Z coordinates are adjustable. Additionally, if needed, a teleport cooldown that blocks PvP teleportation and stop spamming the command is available.
